For CODTECH Internship Task-4, we developed a simple data compression tool using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm, which is one of the most basic forms of lossless compression. We wrote a C program that takes an input string and compresses it by replacing sequences of repeated characters with the character followed by its frequency. A corresponding decompression function was also implemented to reverse the process. The program was tested and executed using the Programiz Online C Compiler, a reliable and accessible platform that supports standard C functions. This task introduced us to the concept of data compression, which is critical in saving memory, reducing file sizes, and improving transmission speeds. In real-world scenarios, compression techniques like RLE are widely used in applications such as ZIP file compression, image formats like BMP and TIFF, and embedded systems where memory is limited. Completing this task deepened our understanding of how algorithms can optimize data handling in software systems.
